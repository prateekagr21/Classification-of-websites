# Predicting the type of Url by using Machine Learning Algorithms!!!

## _UseCase :_
### _Let‚Äôs say we have to categorize web pages. Typically they can be categorized under four heads:_ üï∏Ô∏è
- _E-commerce page (like Amazon)_
- _Listing page (like naukri, zomato etc)_
- _Article (landing page , Blogs)_
- _Video / images pages (YouTube etc)_
### _Devise a function in which input is a URL and output is a prediction (predicting the input URL to be one of the above categories)_

## Now for solving this usecase,
- Fistly i have searched the internet for the dataset and done some web scrapping and then sorted the dataset.
- Checked for null values and observed the data to form meaningful insights.
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the Train and Test dataset.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..
<br> 
### Did Data Preprocessing.
- For solving the error : ValueError: np.nan is an invalid document converting the dtype object to unicode string


## And then I made my model for the Prediction :
### Term freq. and Inverse doc freq. - TF-IDF from Natural Language Processing - NLP.
- Independent and Dependent Features.
- Did Train-Test split<br> <br> <br>


## Fitted the model by using - 
### . Stochastic gradient descent - SGD classifier
- predicted...
- Found the Accuracy score
- Plotted the classification report !

### . Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- predicted...
- Found the Accuracy score
- Plotted the confusion matrix
- Plotted the classification report
and done!
